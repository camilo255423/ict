  month = apr,
  abstract = {A few short years ago, most mobile devices were, for want of a better
	word, "dumb." Sure, there were some early smartphones, but they were
	either entirely e-mail focused or lacked sophisticated touch screens
	that could be used without a stylus. Even fewer shipped with a decent
	mobile browser capable of displaying anything more than simple text,
	links, and maybe an image. This meant if you had one of these devices,
	you were either a businessperson addicted to e-mail or an alpha geek
	hoping that this would be the year of the smartphone. Then Apple
	changed everything with the release of the iPhone, and our expectations
	for mobile experiences were completely reset.
	
	
	The original plan for third-party iPhone apps was to use open Web
	technology. Apple even released tooling for this in its Dashcode
	project.4 Fast-forward three years and native apps are all the rage,
	and—usually for performance reasons—the mobile Web is being unfavorably
	compared.
	
	
	There are two problems with this line of thinking. First, building
	a different app for each platform is very expensive if written in
	each native language. An indie game developer or startup may be able
	to support just one device, likely the iPhone, but an IT department
	will have to support the devices that its users have that may not
	always be the latest and greatest. Second, the performance argument
	that native apps are faster may apply to 3D games or image-processing
	apps, but there is a negligible or unnoticeable performance penalty
	in a well-built business application using Web technology.
	
	
	For its part, Google is betting on Web technology to solve the platform
	fragmentation problem. Vic Gundotra, VP of engineering at Google,
	claimed that "even Google was not rich enough to support all of the
	different mobile platforms from Apple's App Store to those of the
	BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, Android, and the many variations of the
	Nokia platform,"6 and this was before HP webOS, MeeGo, and other
	platforms emerged.
	
	
	In this article we discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of
	both Web and native approaches, with special attention to areas where
	the gap is closing between Web technologies and their native counterparts.
	
	Native Code vs. Web Code
	
	
	Implementing a software app begins with code. In the case of native
	code, most often these days the developer typically writes in a C
	dialect, as in the case of the iPhone. In our work at Nitobi and
	on PhoneGap, we have had plenty of experience wrestling with the
	various mobile platforms from a native development perspective.
	
	
	Of course, for various market or organizational reasons most developers
	or teams have to support apps on multiple smart platforms. Want to
	write an app in native code and hit every single mobile operating
	system? No problem if your team has the skill sets shown in table

  title = {{Framework Design: A Role Modeling Approach}},
  school = {ETH Z\"{u}rich},
  year = {2000},
  address = {Z\"{u}rich, Switzerland},
  abstract = {Role modeling for framework design, as developed in this dissertation,
	makes designing, learning, and using object-oriented frameworks easier
	than possible with traditional class-based approaches.
	
	
	Object-oriented frameworks promise higher productivity and shorter
	time-to-market for the development of object-oriented applications.
	These goals are achieved through design and code reuse. While many
	projects show that these promises can be met, failed projects also
	show that they are not always easy to reach. This dissertation addresses
	three pertinent technical problems of designing, learning, and using
	object-oriented frameworks: complexity of classes, complexity of
	object collaboration, and lack of clarity of requirements put upon
	use-clients of a framework.
	
	
	Role modeling for framework design is an evolutionary extension of
	class-based modeling of frameworks. The method enhances class-based
	modeling with role modeling concepts. In this method, objects play
	roles that are described by role types. An object typically plays
	several roles, so that the class of an object composes several role
	types. Moreover, objects collaborate for several different purposes,
	each of which is called an object collaboration task. Such a task
	is described by a role model. A class model composes all relevant
	role models to describe how instances of its classes collaborate.
	Describing classes as compositions of role types and class models
	as compositions of role models reduces class and object collaboration
	complexity.
	
	
	Going one step further, role modeling for framework design defines
	frameworks as explicit design and implementation artifacts with well-defined
	boundaries. A framework defines how to use it with the help of so-called
	free role types of free role models. A free role model provides free
	role types for roles that clients of a framework have to play to
	make proper use of the framework. Free role types are key to defining
	the requirements put upon use-clients of a framework. Only by acting
	according to free role types from a free role model may use-clients
	make use of framework objects. The dissertation shows how these concepts
	are used to design, use, and layer object-oriented frameworks.
	
	
	Role modeling for framework design represents a significant improvement
	over current practice regarding the initially stated problems of
	framework design. This thesis is validated with the help of three
	case studies that show how role modeling for framework design works
	in practice. Each of the case studies compares a traditional class-based
	framework design with a framework design based on role modeling.
	However, each case study does so from a different angle. The first
	case study on the Geo Object framework compares a traditional design
	with an enhanced role modeling design. The second case study on the
	KMU Desktop Tools framework shows how role modeling helps in the
	redesign of an existing framework and how the redesigned version
	compares to the old version. The third case study on the JHotDraw
	framework for drawing editors shows how an existing well-designed
	framework design can be described even better using role modeling.
	Finally, all three case studies reflect on the experiences made while
	carrying them out.
	
	
	For its validation, the thesis is split up into nine sub-theses, each
	of which has a problem and an activity dimension. The addressed problems
	are class complexity, object collaboration complexity, and lack of
	clarity of requirements put upon use-clients. The activities are
	designing and redesigning a framework, learning a framework, and
	using a framework. For each problem/activity pair an argument is
	made based on the case studies. The overall validation of the thesis
	becomes the validation of all nine problem/activity pairs.
	
	
	Role modeling for framework design combines the strengths of role
	modeling with those of class-based modeling while leaving out their
	weaknesses. It is therefore an evolutionary extension of current
	methods that preserves existing investments. Finally, role modeling
	for framework design is the first comprehensive method to make frameworks
	explicit design artifacts and to introduce modeling concepts for
	directly expressing their unique properties.},
